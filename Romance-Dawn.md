This challenge is a forensics png reconstruction based one. The name of the file we get from the server is `7uffy.png` and a console call of pngcheck gives the following output.

```console
$ pngcheck 7uffy.png 
7uffy.png  illegal (unless recently approved) unknown, public chunk EASY
ERROR: 7uffy.png
```
